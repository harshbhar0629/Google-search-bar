# Google-search-bar

Implementing google search bar using JS.

# Trie-DS

<ul>
    <li>There exist a Data Structure Known as Trie, which is used to prefix-searching</li>
    <li>Why Prefix Searching?? when you search on google it track your word from starting character and in every suggestion your word will be contain may be your spell is wrong then it correct it later but no show any more suggestions</li>
    <li>In My-google-search-bar when you enter a word it track your every character and give suggestions to you</li>
</ul>

<p>We have <strong>TrieNode</strong> and its having two properties: <ul><li><strong>Children</strong> for check any character is present or not</li><li><strong>isEndOfWord</strong> it track the word is end or not at any character</li></ul></p>

<p>We have <strong>Trie</strong> class in which it take reference from <strong>TrieNode</strong> and we have multiple fns are there: <ul><li><strong>Insert:</strong> in this fn we can track every character from prefix check every character it is present or not if yes then goto that character otherwise create its child from missing character</li>
<li><strong>search:</strong> in this fn we can search prefix string from trie and see how many character are present from that particular prefix via another fn  <strong>_findAllWords</strong> this fn helps to detect all string which have common part of given prefix</li></ul></p>

<p>We have alot of words are there generated by ChatGpt so we fetch all words and get uniques words.</p>

<p><strong>words.forEach((word) => trie.insert(word))</strong> via for each loop we can insert all words in trie.</p>

<p>When we input a character it show all suggestions(Words) that having same input</p>
